        <div class="div-toxic">
          Now we propose another reflection about the "industry" of toxic
          positivity. It is easy when we are trying to achieve a better version
          of ourselves to fall into the fallacy that everything in our lives
          depends on how we see it. It is commonly said that if you live by a
          positive ideal, everything has to work out, and if it doesn't, somehow
          it's your fault. This falls back into a toxic cycle where it puts
          pressure on us to be positive at all costs to make our lives work.
          Hard moments are inevitable and are an important part of the healing
          process that can help us grow, whereas trying to achieve utopian
          positivity all the time can hurt and frustrate even more.

            Talking about your problems, being vulnerable is one of the first
            steps not only to improve, but also to understand ourselves better;
            how we process things, how we react to certain situations. It is to
            understand our feelings and feel them freely. Open up to new
            opportunities. Take new decisions that you have never taken before,
            open your mind and learn new things.

          What is the process of self-reflection? Self-reflection can be a
          different process for each of us. It can be a process of dialogue with
          ourselves, reflections about who we are, what our values are, what we
          feel, and how we process and react to the world around us. This
          process can help us see ourselves from another perspective, helping us
          to grow, develop our mental processes, and modulate how we feel about
          our experiences. The way we consume things and experience the world
          today often leads us to blind consumption without reflecting on the
          real impact it all has on us. Sometimes we only reflect on something
          when it becomes big enough to get our attention or starts to raise
          questions or doubts. We are surrounded by thousands of pieces of
          information all the time, with many different inputs, often making us
          less aware of ourselves and consequently paying less attention to what
          we are feeling and thinking.

          At some point, we all need help. It may be from professionals, from
          friends, from family, or from ourselves. However, accepting that we
          need some help is not always simple, as it connects us with the
          vulnerability of being. Sometimes we need a break to understand what
          we are feeling, how things affects us and how we can overcome hard
          times. Helping ourselves is not easy as it seems, and is common that
          we postpone helping the most important person - us. While we feel it
          can be difficult, it can also be empowering to identify why we need
          help and how we can get it. Connecting with others can make us think
          about certain topics from a different perspective, share our fears,
          and in some way lighten the emotional and mental load we often carry.
          In this way, allow yourself to seek for help, we all need some support
          to keep the life going.

        <p class="forgiveness-text">
          Forgiveness plays a big role in our lives. It is often the first step
          to letting go of painful experiences and starting a new chapter. And
          despite its importance, many people forget that we need to forgive
          those around us, but also, and most importantly, ourselves. We often
          have expectations of ourselves, how we should be, how we should behave
          and what we should achieve. These goals are very important and help us
          to move forward in life. However, they are not always realistic and
          not all achievable at once. So, let's forgive ourselves for not always
          achieving our goals and not handling situations the way we would like
          to. Stop beating ourselves up. It may also be a good idea to forgive
          that we do not always treat us the way we deserve. That we are not
          kind to ourselves, that we try to be someone we are not, that we
          neglect our needs, put pressure and are sometimes overly critical.
          Let's forgive ourselves for everything we feel guilty about and then
          let it go in peace. Let's allow us to begin again.

        <p class="understanding-text">
          Understanding is something that can bring us great peace and relief.
          And it is useful on two battlefields - the one with other people, and
          the one with ourselves. From time to time, each of us comes into
          conflict with another person. We may get angry at the situation,
          feeling touched, misunderstood and offended. We ourselves know very
          well why our point of view is the way it is, and where our values and
          opinions come from. But rarely do we take the trouble to understand
          the other person. Understanding the other person's motivation can give
          us clues to end the argument more quickly, or at least calm it down,
          and that brings peace to us. It doesn't mean agreeing with the other
          person, just listening to them with a calm and open mind. It is
          probably clear to you that understanding ourselves is the way to be
          content and fulfilled. Knowing which values and dreams are more
          important to us than others. But it's just as necessary to know where
          those desires come from - why we long so much for a cozy home or to
          travel the world, why we find the partners we do. Realizing which
          wounds are still unhealed is the path to happiness.
