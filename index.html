            about the "industry" of toxic positivity. It is easy when we are

            trying to achieve a better version of ourselves to fall into the
            <br />
            fallacy that everything in our lives depends on how we see it. It is
            <br />
            commonly said that if you live by a positive ideal, everything has
            <br />
            to work out, and if it doesn't, somehow it's your fault. This falls
            <br />
            back into a toxic cycle where it puts pressure on us to be positive
            <br />
            at all costs to make our lives work. Hard moments are inevitable and
            <br />
            are an important part of the healing process that can help us grow,
            <br />
            whereas trying to achieve utopian positivity all the time can hurt
            <br />
            and frustrate even more.

        What is the process of self-reflection? Self-reflection can be a
        different process for each of us. It can be a process of dialogue with
        ourselves, reflections about who we are, what our values are, what we
        feel, and how we process and react to the world around us. This process
        can help us see ourselves from another perspective, helping us to grow,
        develop our mental processes, and modulate how we feel about our
        experiences. The way we consume things and experience the world today
        often leads us to blind consumption without reflecting on the real
        impact it all has on us. Sometimes we only reflect on something when it
        becomes big enough to get our attention or starts to raise questions or
        doubts. We are surrounded by thousands of pieces of information all the
        time, with many different inputs, often making us less aware of
        ourselves and consequently paying less attention to what we are feeling
        and thinking.

        At some point, we all need help. It may be from professionals, from
        friends, from family, or from ourselves. However, accepting that we need
        some help is not always simple, as it connects us with the vulnerability
        of being. Sometimes we need a break to understand what we are feeling,
        how things affects us and how we can overcome hard times. Helping
        ourselves is not easy as it seems, and is common that we postpone
        helping the most important person - us. While we feel it can be
        difficult, it can also be empowering to identify why we need help and
        how we can get it. Connecting with others can make us think about
        certain topics from a different perspective, share our fears, and in
        some way lighten the emotional and mental load we often carry. In this
        way, allow yourself to seek for help, we all need some support to keep
        the life going.

          Forgiveness plays a big role in our lives. It is often the first step
          to letting go of painful experiences and starting a new chapter.
          Despite its importance, many people forget that we need to forgive
          those around us, but also, and most importantly, ourselves. We often
          have expectations of ourselves, how we should be, how we should behave
          and what we should achieve. These goals are very important and help us
          to move forward in life. However, they are not always realistic and
          not all achievable at once.
        </p>
        <p class="p-fogiveness">
          So, let's forgive ourselves for not always achieving our goals and not
          handling situations the way we would like to. Stop beating ourselves
          up. It may also be a good idea to forgive that we do not always treat
          us the way we deserve. That we are not kind to ourselves, that we try
          to be someone we are not, that we neglect our needs, put pressure and
          are sometimes overly critical. Let's forgive ourselves for everything
          we feel guilty about and then let it go in peace. Let's allow us to
          begin again.

      <p class="understanding-text">
        Understanding is something that can bring us great peace and relief. And
        it is useful on two battlefields - the one with other people, and the
        one with ourselves. From time to time, each of us comes into conflict
        with another person. We may get angry at the situation, feeling touched,
        misunderstood and offended. We ourselves know very well why our point of
        view is the way it is, and where our values and opinions come from. But
        rarely do we take the trouble to understand the other person.
        Understanding the other person's motivation can give us clues to end the
        argument more quickly, or at least calm it down, and that brings peace
        to us. It doesn't mean agreeing with the other person, just listening to
        them with a calm and open mind. It is probably clear to you that
        understanding ourselves is the way to be content and fulfilled. Knowing
        which values and dreams are more important to us than others. But it's
        just as necessary to know where those desires come from - why we long so
        much for a cozy home or to travel the world, why we find the partners we
        do. Realizing which wounds are still unhealed is the path to happiness.
