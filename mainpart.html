    <p class="opening">Talking about your problems, being vulnerable is one of the first steps not only to improve, but also to understand ourselves better; how we process things, how we react to certain situations. It is to understand our feelings and feel them freely.
    Open up to new opportunities. Take new decisions that you have never taken before, open your mind and learn new things.

    Learning to deal with our feelings during difficult times. Have compassion for yourself. Not every day is going to be good, and that's okay. Sometimes we use words to describe ourselves that are hurtful—words we wouldn't use to describe someone else. Feel at peace with your own company.

    What is the process of self-reflection?
    Self-reflection can be a different process for each of us. It can be a process of dialogue with ourselves, reflections about who we are, what our values are, what we feel, and how we process and react to the world around us.
    This process can help us see ourselves from another perspective, helping us to grow, develop our mental processes, and modulate how we feel about our experiences.
    The way we consume things and experience the world today often leads us to blind consumption without reflecting on the real impact it all has on us. Sometimes we only reflect on something when it becomes big enough to get our attention or starts to raise questions or doubts. We are surrounded by thousands of pieces of information all the time, with many different inputs, often making us less aware of ourselves and consequently paying less attention to what we are feeling and thinking.

<p class="help-text">At some point, we all need help. It may be from professionals, from friends, from family, or from ourselves. However, accepting that we need some help is not always simple, as it connects us with the vulnerability of being. 
    Sometimes we need a break to understand what we are feeling,  how things affects us and how we can overcome hard times. Helping ourselves is not easy as it seems, and is common that we postpone helping the most important person - us.
    While we feel it can be difficult, it can also be empowering to identify why we need help and how we can get it. Connecting with others can make us think about certain topics from a different perspective, share our fears, and in some way lighten the emotional and mental load we often carry.
    In this way, allow yourself to seek for help, we all need some support to keep the life going.

    <p class="forgiveness-text">Forgiveness plays a big role in our lives. It is often the first step to letting go of painful experiences and starting a new chapter. And despite its importance, many people forget that we need to forgive those around us, but also, and most importantly, ourselves. 

        We often have expectations of ourselves, how we should be, how we should behave and what we should achieve. These goals are very important and help us to move forward in life. However, they are not always realistic and not all achievable at once. So, let's forgive ourselves for not always achieving our goals and not handling situations the way we would like to. Stop beating ourselves up.
        
        It may also be a good idea to forgive that we do not always treat us the way we deserve. That we are not kind to ourselves, that we try to be someone we are not, that we neglect our needs, put pressure and are sometimes overly critical. 
        
        Let's forgive ourselves for everything we feel guilty about and then let it go in peace. Let's allow us to begin again. </p>

    <p class="understanding-title-colored">UNDERSTANDING</p>
    <p class="understanding-text">Understanding is something that can bring us great peace and relief. And it is useful on two battlefields - the one with other people, and the one with ourselves. 

        From time to time, each of us comes into conflict with another person. We may get angry at the situation, feeling touched, misunderstood and offended. We ourselves know very well why our point of view is the way it is, and where our values and opinions come from. But rarely do we take the trouble to understand the other person. 
        Understanding the other person's motivation can give us clues to end the argument more quickly, or at least calm it down, and that brings peace to us. It doesn't mean agreeing with the other person, just listening to them with a calm and open mind. 
        
        It is probably clear to you that understanding ourselves is the way to be content and fulfilled. Knowing which values and dreams are more important to us than others. But it's just as necessary to know where those desires come from - why we long so much for a cozy home or to travel the world, why we find the partners we do. Realizing which wounds are still unhealed is the path to happiness.
